# bootcamp_demo  

An exploration into Learnosity's API's as part of Learnosity's induction / bootcamp program.

You'll see React is installed on the client side but I've not linked it all up - was going to do it today.

When you unzip the attached, you'll need to install the dependencies by typing:

npm install 

What I've done is all in the server subfolder.

To run the Learnosity, navigate to the server subfolder and type:

```node server.js```

or

```npm run start```

or 

```npm run watch```

All of the above will work.

You'll notice I'm porting to server port 3001.

Once the server is running, open your browser and type localhost:3001 

The magic should then happen!

lol.
